This Python code helps to formatting the given text by using some simple rules. It reads from a `.docx` file, fixes the text according to UK spelling conventions, substitutes abbreviations such as "eg" with "for example", and deals with name rules of formatting. For titles, the script preserves the full title in first occurrence (e.g., Dr Manmohan Singh) and employs the abbreviated version (e.g., Dr Singh) for follow-up mentions unless there is confusion. The script also appends periods to initials (e.g., Franklin D. Roosevelt). The script does not employ `python-docx` and utilizes `pywin32` instead, so it will only run on Windows with Microsoft Word installed. To execute it, install `pywin32` by running `pip install pywin32`, put your input file as `input.docx` in the same directory as the script, and execute the script by running `python text_formatter.py`. The corrected output will be in `output.docx`.
